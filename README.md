🌱 Envithon Plant Disease Detection
📌 Overview

Envithon Plant Disease Detection is a machine learning–powered project designed to detect plant diseases from leaf images. It combines a deep learning model (YOLOv8 + TensorFlow/Keras) with a simple Flask-based web frontend to provide real-time plant disease predictions.

🚀 Features

Upload an image of a plant leaf through the web app.

Model predicts if the plant is healthy or diseased.

Uses YOLOv8 for object detection and a CNN (Keras/TensorFlow) for classification.

Frontend built with Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository or extract the zip:

git clone <repo-link>
